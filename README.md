# Random Features

This is a project of course "Structured Data: Learning, Prediction Dependency, Testing" of Master Data Sciences at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

## Citation

This project is an implementation of random features proposed in the following paper:

* **Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines**,
Ali Rahimi and Ben Recht. NIPS, 2007.

## Structure

I implemented Random Fourier features. The experiments are on digits and california housing datasets of scikit-learn.

`main.py` can be run 

`rff.py` gives the Random Fourier features class

`utils.py` gives some helper functions

TODO: Random Binning features
